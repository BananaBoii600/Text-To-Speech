# Text-To-Speech
[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

Text to speech made in [python](https://www.python.org) using `pyttsx3` and `tkinter`

The code has comments, thus can be easily understood

I can only provide Linux executables atm, if you want a windows executable, you can download the source code and use pyinstaller to convert it to a executable file

# Dependencies

This app requires [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) and some python modules to be installed in your computer.

The app uses `tkinter` for gui, thus it is required for the user to install tkinter by typing the following command in the command prompt/terminal
```sh
pip install tk
```
The app also uses `pyttsx3` for the main text to speech, thus it is required to install pyttsx3 by typing the following command in the command prompt/terminal
```sh
pip install pyttsx3==2.71
```
Alternatively, the user can also download all the modules by simply opening command prompt/terminal and navigating to the folder which contains the repository and entering the following command
```sh
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```
